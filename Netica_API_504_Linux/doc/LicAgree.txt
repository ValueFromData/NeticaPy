          NORSYS LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR NETICA         Norsys Agreement #116
          -----------------------------------


1. By downloading, copying, or using the Netica software you are agreeing 
to be bound by the terms of this license. If you do not agree to the 
terms of this license, do not download, or promptly delete the unused 
software, and notify Norsys for a full refund.


GRANT and RESTRICTED USE. 
2. Norsys Software Corp. ("Norsys") hereby grants you, the licensee, a
non-exclusive license to use the Netica Application and Netica API software 
products ("Netica") subject to the provisions contained herein.

3. For the purposes of this Agreement, your site is defined as your university,
school or home if you have an educational/personal license, or your company if
you have a commercial license, but in any case also restricted to a single 
geographical region of less than 2 kilometers in diameter.  If you are not 
using Netica with a password, your site can be any of the above as you choose.

4. You may make unlimited copies of Netica or its documentation, provided they
are copied unmodified and in their entirety, including their copyright notice.
Netica may be installed on a local network, or otherwise distributed at your 
site.  Netica may be used by multiple people at your site, providing they all 
follow the provisions of this Agreement.  If you wish to use Netica as part 
of a web server, or as part of software that you distribute, special licenses 
for those purposes must be obtained from Norsys.

5. If you know a password (also termed a "license number") for Netica, you must 
make reasonable effort to ensure that the knowledge of, and the use of, that 
password remains restricted to your site, and, unless you have a site license, 
or a "No Charge" license, that the number of computers simultaneously running 
Netica with that password is never more than the number of copies of Netica 
purchased for your site, even if Netica is embedded in other software.  
You must not use Netica with a password that has not been issued by Norsys to 
a member of your site, or which has been obtained in a way which violates this 
Agreement.

6. You must not modify Netica, or its password protection, or use a modified 
version of Netica, but you may create software which contains Netica, in which 
case all provisions of this Agreement still apply to the embedded Netica.  
The derived software must contain a valid copyright notice, either your own or 
the Norsys copyright notice.

7. You acknowledge that Netica in source code form remains a confidential trade
secret of Norsys and therefore you agree not to attempt to decipher,
decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise reduce Netica to a
human-perceivable form, or allow others to do so.

8. TITLE.  Netica and its documentation is protected by the copyright laws of
Canada and international copyright treaties.  Netica and its documentation is
not sold to you, but licensed for your use.  Norsys maintains all title,
ownership rights, and intellectual property rights to Netica and its
documentation.  No license, right or interest in any trademark, trade name or
service mark are granted under this Agreement.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of
Netica is at your sole risk.  Netica and related documents are provided 
"AS IS" and without warranty of any kind and Norsys EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  NORSYS
DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN NETICA WILL MEET YOUR
REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF NETICA WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN NETICA WILL BE CORRECTED.  FURTHERMORE, NORSYS
DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS
OF THE USE OF NETICA OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS,
ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE
GIVEN BY NORSYS OR A NORSYS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY
OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY.  SHOULD THE NETICA SOFTWARE
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU (AND NOT NORSYS OR A NORSYS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE)
ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL NORSYS OR ITS SUPPLIERS
OR RESELLERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER, WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE GROUNDS, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS,
OR LOST DATA, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE NETICA OR ITS
DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF NORSYS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.  NORSYS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION,
WARRANTY, OR CONDITION CONCERNING PRODUCT, SOFTWARE, OR DOCUMENTATION NOT
MANUFACTURED BY NORSYS, SUCH AS THIRD-PARTIES' PROGRAMS THAT ARE DESIGNED
USING NORSYS SOFTWARE OR WHICH INCLUDE NORSYS PROGRAMS, FILES, OR INFORMATION.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.  In no event shall Norsys's total liability to you for all
damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you for Netica.

11. EXPORT CONTROLS.  You may not download or otherwise export or re-export Netica
or its documentation or any other Norsys technical data except in full
compliance with all Canadian and other applicable laws and regulations. 
By downloading or using Netica, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you are
representing and warranting that you are not located in any country to which
Canada has embargoed goods.

12. TERMINATION.  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  Norsys may
terminate this Agreement at any time, and without notice, if you fail to
comply with any provision of this Agreement.  Upon termination you must
destroy all copies of the Netica software, all parts or modifications of the
Netica software including parts or modifications embedded in other software,
all Netica documentation, and any other relevant information received from
Norsys, that is in your possession or that you have supplied or made available
to a third party.

13. GENERAL.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
concerning the subject matter thereof.  No amendment to or modification of
this Agreement will be binding unless in writing and signed by you and an
authorized officer of Norsys.  THE ACCEPTANCE OF ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED BY
YOU IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON YOUR ASSENT TO THE TERMS SET FORTH
HEREIN, AND NORSYS AGREES TO FURNISH NETICA AND DOCUMENTATION ONLY UPON THESE
TERMS AND NOT THOSE CONTAINED IN YOUR PURCHASE ORDER.  This Agreement shall be
governed by, subject to and interpreted in accordance with Canadian law, and
you and Norsys shall submit to the jurisdiction of the Canadian court.  If for
any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this
Agreement to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum
extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the
remainder of the agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
